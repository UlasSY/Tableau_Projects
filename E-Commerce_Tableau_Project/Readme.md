# Delivery Performance Dashboard

This Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of delivery performance across different regions and states in the United States. It visualizes key metrics such as the percentage of successful deliveries, late deliveries, and failed deliveries, helping businesses track and improve their delivery operations.

## Key Features

### 1. **Percentage of Successful Deliveries by Region**
   - Visual representation of the successful delivery rates in four major regions: West, Central, South, and East.
   - Each region's success rate is displayed as a percentage on the map.
   - Example: The West region has a 40.83% success rate, while the East has 41.14%.

### 2. **Percentage of Failed Deliveries by State**
   - A heat map showing the states with the highest failure rates for deliveries.
   - States are color-coded, with darker red indicating higher failure rates.
   - Example: Louisiana has a particularly high failure rate at 65.18%.

### 3. **Percentage of Late Deliveries by State**
   - Another heat map displays the late deliveries percentage for each state.
   - Late deliveries are shown using a gradient of orange colors, where darker shades represent a higher percentage of late deliveries.
   - Example: Late deliveries are notably higher in the Midwest states.

### 4. **Overall Performance by States**
   - Separate maps and visualizations show successful delivery rates for each state.
   - This allows for a detailed comparison between different states and their delivery performance.

## Filters
   - You can filter data based on different regions (Central, East, South, West) using the filter box on the right side.
   - The delivery status filter also lets you focus on Successful, Late, or Failed deliveries.

## Usage
This dashboard can be used by logistics and operations teams to:
   - Identify regions or states where delivery success is lower.
   - Develop strategies to improve delivery performance in areas with high failure or late rates.
   - Focus resources on problem areas to increase efficiency.

## Technologies Used
